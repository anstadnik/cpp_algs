# This is a collection of useful C++ stuff

## 3rd_party

Here I have useful stuff I found on the internet that I use.

* [termcolor.hpp](https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/termcolor) can be used to change the parameters of the code which is printed to console.
* [backward.hpp](https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp) generates useful backtraces on errors.
